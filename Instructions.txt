Goal: produce a simple question answering (QA) system using regular expressions to retrieve information from a single news article related to the stock market

system should be able to:
- respond to a list of queries from a file (each query is on a separate line)
  - respond to each line
  - terminate when it reaches the end of the file
- respond to a query from interactive console input
  - loop until the user quits

development data:
- sample questions that system should be able to handle

system training:
- provided 2 articles for training
- assume that each sentence in an article file appears on a separate line
- assume that there is a blank line between each paragraph

You may rely on NLP analysis tools available on the web (e.g. part-of-speech taggers, morphological analyzers) but you must indicate:
1. which ones you use
2. for what purpose
3. where they were obtained

GRADING
Functionality (80pts)
1. Functionality (42pts)
   - correctly handle the following questions:
     1. Did <index> rise or fall?
     2. Did <company stock> rise or fall?
     3. How much did <index> rise/fall?
     4. How much did <company stock> rise/fall?
     5. How much did <index> close/open at?
     6. How much did <company stock> close/open at?
   - handle paraphrases of the questions for indices
     1. for example "Dow Jones" or "Dow Jones industrials" or "the industrial average"
     2. verbs such as "rise" or "climb"
   - always provide source for the answer (i.e. the sentence where the answer came from)
   - if the file mentions any rise or fall throughout the day or in the past, you should mention it
   - examples:
     1. Q: How much did the Dow Jones close at?
     	A: 2569.26
	Source: "The Dow Jones industrials closed at 2659.26" (line 25)
     2. Q: How much did the Industrials Average close at?
     	A: 2569.26
	Source: "The Dow Jones industrials closed at 2659.26" (line 25)
     3. Q: Did Delta Airlines rise or fall?
     	A: It fell.
	Source: "For example, their selling caused trading halts to be declared in USAir Group, which closed down 3 7/8 to 41 1/2, Delta Air Lines, which fell 7 3/4 to 69 1/4, and Philips Industries, which sank 3 to 21 1/2." (line 43)
     4. Q: How much did Delta Airlines drop?
     	A: 7 3/4
	Source:"For example, their selling caused trading halts to be declared in USAir Group, which closed down 3 7/8 to 41 1/2, Delta Air Lines, which fell 7 3/4 to 69 1/4, and Philips Industries, which sank 3 to 21 1/2." (line 43)
2. Regular Expression Templates (8pts)
   - have good regular expression templates for questions
   - have good regular expression templates for answers
   - quality over quantity
     1. have more general regular expressions that can match multiple questions/kinds of sentences for the answer are better than rigid expressions that match only one string
     2. more general regular expressions means fewer overall
3. Preciseness of Answer (10pts)
   - be as specific as possible
     1. for example, the first answer above should be "2569.26" not "closed at 2569.26"
4. Multiple Answers (10pts)
   - list all possible answers
   - will be penalized for missed answers
   - for example:
     Q: How much did the Dow Jones fall?
     A1: 55
     Source1: "The Dow Jones industrials were down 55 points at 3 p.m. before the futures-trading halt." (line 66)
     A2: 114.73
     Source2: "At 3:30 p.m., at the end of the "cooling off" period, the average was down 114.76 points." (line 67)
5. No Answer Available (10pts)
   - correctly identify when there is no answer
   - example:
     Q: How much did the S&P market rise?
     A: No information available.
6. Incorrect Answer
   - you will be penalized for wrong answers
   - example:
     Q: How much did the Dow fall?
     A: Dow Richardson
     Source: "-- Dow Richardson." (line 5)
Software Engineering (20pts)
1. README.md contains
   - names and email addresses
   - Assignment 1
   - a description of every file, the programming language used, supporting files, any NLP tools used, etc.
   - how the QA system works, in detail
   - a description of special features of the QA system
   - a description of limitations of the QA system
2. Code Documentation
   - methods/functions/procedures should be documented in a meaningful way
     1. this can mean expressive function names as well as explicit documentation
   - informative method/function/procedure/variable names
   - efficient implementation
   - Programmer, Memory, and Processor efficiency
     1. don't sacrifice one unless another is improved
   - dont hardcode variable values, etc.

SUBMISSION
- if language requires compilation, include shell script that automatically compiles code ON EECIS MACHINE
  - called "make.sh"
- include simple perl wrapper called hw1.pl
  - this is so that your program can be run as follows on the eecis machines):
    $ perl hw1.pl <financial article> (<qa filename>)
    - note that <qa filename> is optional, as your QA must respond to both queries from a file and interactive console input
    - Hint: this simple perl script lists the contents of the present working directory:
      print 'ls'
- when system is complete, submit through canvas
